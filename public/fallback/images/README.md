# Placeholder Images for Music Video Generator

This directory contains placeholder images that are used when the OpenAI DALL-E API is unavailable.

## Usage:

1. These images will be used automatically if the image generation API call fails.
2. You can replace these with your own images if desired (keep the same filenames).
3. The application will randomly select from these images when needed.

## Sources:

These placeholder images are from Lorem Picsum (https://picsum.photos/), a free image placeholder service.
